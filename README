Twitter Backup

Setup:
1 - Install the twython module from http://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython
2 - Install the MySQLdb module
3 - Install MySQL and create a database to store everything in.
4 - Run setupdb.py DBHOST DBUSER DBPASS to setup the database

Running:
Run:
	$ backup.py DBHOST DBUSER DBPASS DBNAME
and authenticate yourself using your twitter information and type in the 
person's username who you wish you back up. Each time you run the script, 
everyone who is already in the database will be checked again.

TODO:
1 - Check api calls and sleep for 1 hour if we're too low. 
2 - Error handling for stuff...

Problems:
There may be some problems with authentication. If these errors occur, just 
try running the script again. That usually solves the problem. I'm not sure 
why these problems happen in the first place.
